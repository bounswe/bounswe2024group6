# User Manual

**Bulingo** is a English-learning app catered to Turkish learners of all levels. The app consists of three main components: Quizzes, Forums and Profile. The navigation is done through the top bar in the website, and from the bottom bar in the mobile app.

## Getting Started
You can browse the quiz and forum feeds without signing up, but to get the most out of the app you must first create an account. You can easily do that by providing your email address, username and password through the website or the mobile app.

## Quizzes

In **Bulingo**, quizzes are created by community members, and you can create a quiz right after signing up! 

To create one, you can navigate to the quiz section and press the pen icon on the bottom right (web) or the plus icon on the top right (mobile). Then you'll have to add a title, a description and a target level for your quiz. In the web interface, you also have the option to add a picture to display alongside your quiz and any additional tags you see fit. Afterwards, you can add as many questions as you'd like. In **Bulingo** quizzes, there are three different kinds of questions: English to Turkish translations, Turkish to English translations and English word sense. When you decide on the question type, **Bulingo** helps you by giving suggestions for both the right and wrong answers. You also have the option to automatically generate an image for your question, which you can manually edit later.

Finding quizzes is really simple in **Bulingo**. You can use the search bar at the top (web) or bottom (mobile) to search for any specific quiz you'd like. In the quiz page, you also get a personalized view of the apps available in the app. You can also filter the quizzes by tags and/or level if you wish.

To solve a quiz, you can press on any quiz you see and press the 'Take Quiz' button. Afterwards, you will have to answer each question. At the end, you'll see your result. Then, you'll have the option to retake the quiz or review it. During the review, you are shown both the answer you picked and the correct answer for each question. Here, you can use the built-in dictionary to help with your lerning process (more on that in the Profile & Additional Features section).

## Forums

**Bulingo** forums are meant to be a place for the community to share their thoughts, ask questions and help others.

You are able to create forum posts by first navigating to the forums section from the navigation bar and then clicking the create button in the top left (mobile) or bottom right (web). Then, you can add a title to your post, add any tags you see fit (including custom ones), write a description and then publish your post.

You also have the option to add your comments under any post. To do that, you must first click on the post you want to comment on and then write your comment below.

In **Bulingo**, you also have the option to search for both posts and comments through the search bar, so you can easily find what you are looking for.

## Profile & Additional Features

**Bulingo** aims to create a strong community of language-learners that will foster the growth of its members' English skill. To enable this, the app has a plethora of other features catered towards this goal.

Firstly, there is the bookmarking and liking functionality. You can bookmark any post, comment or quiz you encounter while using the app, and you can later view them from your profile. You are also able to see the quizzes, posts and comments you liked, and the like count for each is shown throughout the app so other community members know what is popular.

The users also have the ability to follow each other. To do this, you have to first navigate to a user's profile by either searching or pressing on their name/profile picture in the Quizzes or Forums. Here, you can see the quizzes they have created/solved, and their forum posts and comments. Then you can press the Follow button to follow that user.

Which brings us to notifications. Users of **Bulingo** receive notifications whenever a relevant event happens. You can access the notifications from the bell icon found in the top right (web) or the bottom bar (mobile). Among these notifications are the following:
* Someone starts following you
* Someone solves your quiz
* Someone you follow creates a post/comment/quiz
* Someone likes your post/comment/quiz
* An admin deletes your post/quiz

That's right, there are also admin users in **Bulingo** who have special permissions. They can delete quizzes, posts and comments; change their tags (including level); and ban other users. An admin can view the options available to them by pressing and holding on the related component in the mobile app. The same options appear as buttons in the web app.

The final feature **Bulingo** has is the built-in dictionary. Users are able to press and hold any English word they see in the forums or when reviewing a quiz to see its different meanings, example sentences and translations. Each word in the dictionary can also be pressed to open the dictionary entry for that word. You also have the option to bookmark the words on the top right of the dictionary. You can review these words later from your profile.
