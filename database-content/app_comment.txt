  1 | I use American accent daily and I think it's the easiest to learn! But no one can deny that British accent sounds better.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2024-12-16 18:24:15.125719+00 |          0 |         1 |           |      25
  3 | Wow. I always use this as a countable word.

  4 | Definitely not Australia and Ireland, hahah. Their accents are so hard to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2024-12-16 18:27:45.965432+00 |          0 |         1 |           |      10
  5 | Well, I will have to disagree with elifnd here. Just because you are not familiar with the accent does not mean that their English are bad.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2024-12-16 18:31:16.281378+00 |          0 |         7 |           |      10
  6 | This is one of the hardest topics to get right in the language honestly. You just have to get used to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2024-12-16 18:36:08.484718+00 |          0 |         7 |           |       7
  7 | I think it's a tradition because the English speaking world is mostly Christian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2024-12-16 18:38:08.115539+00 |          0 |         7 |           |      14

 15 | Great explanation of 'break the ice'! üåü One of my favorite idioms is 'hit the sack', which means to go to bed or sleep. For example: 'I‚Äôm so tired after work, I think I‚Äôll hit the sack early tonight.'                                                                                                                        +| 2024-12-16 18:44:00.715355+00 |          0 |         2 |           |      15

 16 |  'Bake' usually refers to cooking food in an oven without direct exposure to a flame, like bread or cake, while 'roast' involves dry heat but often applies to meats or vegetables, sometimes with higher temperatures to brown the surface. As for 'spicy' vs 'hot', I really would like to know that as well. Any idea, anyone? | 2024-12-16 18:44:02.741994+00 |          0 |         8 |        11 |      11

    | Nouns tend to stress the first syllable (e.g., REcord).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          +|                               |            |           |           |
